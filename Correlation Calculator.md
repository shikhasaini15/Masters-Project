The Correlation Calculator is a standalone Java program that computes pairwise correlations for repeatedly measured variables. It is intended for quantitative metabolite data such as LC‑MS or GC‑MS measurements collected across a set of samples. The tool lets you view intermediate results, export files at each step, and finally import the correlation table into MetScape v3.1 or later as a correlation‑based network.
The calculator can be downloaded from the MetScape website (https://metscape.ncibi.org/calculator.html). It accepts a CSV file containing a matrix of metabolite intensities; metabolites must be identified, while sample identifiers are optional. The matrix can be oriented with samples in rows or in columns, and the program will handle either layout.
Metabolomics experiments often generate hundreds to thousands of metabolites, many of which lack direct pathway annotations. Correlation analysis provides a data‑driven way to discover groups of metabolites that co‑vary across samples, revealing hidden biochemical relationships, shared regulation, or common sources of technical variation. By converting these correlations into a network within MetScape, researchers can visualize and explore functional modules, prioritize candidates for further validation, and integrate the results with existing pathway information thereby gaining mechanistic insight that would be missed by pathway‑only approaches.
